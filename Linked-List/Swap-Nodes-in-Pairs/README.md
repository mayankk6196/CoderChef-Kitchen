### Solution 1: Recursive Approach

#### Motivation

The question has asked us to swap nodes in pairs. This means we can reach to the end of the linked list by jumping in pairs of two in a recursive manner.

</p>

While back tracking the nodes are swapped.

</p>

> This means every recursion call breaks the list at the second node and forwards the remaining list in next recursion.

#### Algorithm

Let's say every time we get into a recursion call, `head` points to the head of the remaining list or the first node of the next pair.

1. The base condition for recursion is to check if either of  `head` or `head.next` is pointing to a null. This would mean we don't have a pair of elements to swap for the current recursion call.
2. Let's represent the two nodes to be swapped by `firstNode` and `secondNode`.
    ```
    firstNode = head
    secondNode = head.next
    ```
    <p align="center">

    </p>

3. Make a recursive call to the function with head of the next pair of nodes.

    </p>

    This call would swap the next two nodes and return the pointer to the now first node of the swapped nodes.

    </p>

    Once we get the pointer to the remaining swapped list from the recursion call, we can swap the `firstNode` and `secondNode` i.e. the nodes in the current recursive call and return the pointer to the `secondNode` since it will be the new head after swapping.

  4. Once all the pairs are swapped in the backtracking step, we would eventually be returning the pointer to the head swapped original list. This head will essentially be the second node in the original linked list.

#### Complexity Analysis

* Time Complexity: `O(N)` where N is the size of the linked list.
* Space Complexity: `O(N)` Stack space utilized for recursion.

### Solution 2: Iterative Approach

#### Motivation

The concept is similar to the recursive approach. We break the linked list into pairs by jumping in steps of two. The only difference is, instead of repeatedly swapping nodes fro the end, like what we achieved using recursion, we do the same thing from the beginning. After swapping a pair of nodes, say `A` and `B`, we need to link the node `B` to the node that came before `A` to maintain the required links. So we save the previous node in a variable `prevNode`.

#### Algorithm

1. We iterate the linked list and after swapping two nodes, we jump to the next pair.

2. Let's represent the two nodes to be swapped by `firstNode` and `secondNode`.

    <p align="center">
    <img src="../../Images/Swap-Nodes-in-Pairs/algorithm_10.png" width="500">

3. Swap the two nodes. The swap step is
    ```
    firstNode.next = secondNode.next
    secondNode.next = firstNode
    ```
    <p align="center">
    <img src="../../Images/Swap-Nodes-in-Pairs/algorithm_11.png" width="500">

4. We also need to assign the prevNode's next to the head of the swapped pair.
    ```
    prevNode.next = secondNode
    ```
    <p align="center">
    <img src="../../Images/Swap-Nodes-in-Pairs/algorithm_12.png" width="500">

    This step would ensure the currently swapped pair is linked to the end of the previously swapped list.

This is an iterative step, so the nodes are swapped on the go and attached to the previously swapped list. And in the end we get the final swapped list.
