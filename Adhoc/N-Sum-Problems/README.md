Well, as you can tell, we love dim ***sums***. Haha!

This folder contains a series of similar kind of problems that are very frequently asked in programming interviews. All of these problems follow the same pattern.

Essentially, we are given a list of numbers and a certain target value and we have to find tuples of `N` numbers that add up to the given target value.

Sounds simple, right?

Two sum is one of the most fundamental and easiest problem to solve of the lot. There are multiple approaches for solving this problem and they are listed [here](2Sum/README.md).

Rest of the problems have their solutions based on the approaches listed for the two sum problem. So, if you have solved the two sum problem and are versed with the various approaches that can be used to solve it, you should be able to solve rest of the problems as well with a slight modification.

Different variants for a given `N Sum` problem can be:

1. Find a single tuple of `N` elements that sum to a given target.
2. Find if there exists a tuple of `N` elements that sums to `0`.
3. Return the indices of a tuple of `N` elements that sum to a given target value.
4. Find *all* unique tuples of `N` elements which sum to a given target value.

Read all the articles in this folder and solve these problems to get a better grasp over the concepts.
