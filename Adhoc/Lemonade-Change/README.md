### Solution 1: Greedy Approach

#### Motivation

* This problem demands a basic greedy approach all of us follow in our day to day life.
`Let me save the change, I might need it later`.

* Consider a basic scenario.
`You have two $5 notes and one $10 notes.`

You go to the market and buy an energy bar for $10.

How would you pay?

Credit Card. LOL.

No. You are not carrying that. You just have two $5 and one $10 notes.

If you are like me, you would give the $10 note and keep those two $5 notes for later.

`Why? Because...`

So now you want to have a cup of green tea which would cost $5 and the tea vendor has a board outside his shop which says `Only $5 notes accepted.` Now, in this case you need to have those two $5 notes. Had you given the two $5 notes earlier for the energy bar, you would not have been able to have the delicious green tea :P

#### Algorithm

1. This is all this questions wants. Be greedy!

2. You just have to deal with $5, $10, $20 notes. Since $20 is the highest currency note it won't be utilized as a change.

3. You just keep a count of $5 and $10 notes you have at any point in time.

4. If you are able to provide the change from your current notes collection, you return True, otherwise False.

5. Scenarios you might face:
    1. The customer comes in with a `$5` note. In that case you just add it to your collection. `Five-Dollar-Notes + 1`
    2. The customer comes in with a `$10` note. In that case you need to return $5 to the customer. You check if you have a $5 note, if you do, then you take it out from your collection and give it to the customer. Also add the $10 to your collection. `Five-Dollar-Notes - 1` and `Ten-Dollar-Notes + 1`
    3. The customer comes in with a `$20` note. In that case you need to return $15 to the customer. Now you could either give back `one $10 and one $5` or `three $5`. If you are smart, you would first try the former option. Since you would want to reserve the $5 notes for later use. Also you don't add $20 to your change collections, Since you can't exchange it for any other transaction. So you either do (`Five-Dollar-Notes - 1` and `Ten-Dollar-Notes - 1`) or `Five-Dollar-Notes - 3`.

#### Complexity Analysis

* Time Complexity: `O(N)`, where N is the length of bills.
* Space Complexity: `O(1)`.
